# Sound Detector with LED

This project combines a sound detection program with LED control to create a system that responds to detected sounds by illuminating an LED. The sound detection program continuously monitors audio input from a microphone and triggers the LED to turn on when specific sound patterns are detected. 
#### Components Used
1. Arduino UNO
2. LED
3. Sound Detector (KY-038)
